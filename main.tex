	add intro fluff kind of stff here

	This thesis focuses on the implementation and development of a 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) guidance algorithm that solves the powered descent guidance (PDG) problem. I present a modified version of the Szmuk-Acikmese 6-DoF algorithm presented in \cite{szmuk2018successive}. I present a similar algorithm utilizing Modified Rodrigues Parameters (MRPs) as the attitude formalism. This simplifies the formation to three parameters, from four, and does not require a norm constrain a every time step.

	Foremost, I am thankful to Dr. Robert D. Braun for his support and advising through my work at Colorado Boulder. I would like to thank Professor Jay McMahon and Professor Hanspeter Schaub for serving on my committee and for their fulfilling coursework and advising. Additionally, I would like to thank Dr. Mason Peck for his four years of support at Cornell, which serve as my foundation in this field.

	I am also grateful for the insightful and thrilling technical discussions I have had with Sven Niederberger, Benjamin Chung, Janis Maczijewski, Joe Barnard, Miki Szmuk, Skye Mceowen, Ian Garcia, Shez Virani, Daniel Aguilar-Marsillach, the EsDL research team, and many more.
	
	Similarly, I would like to thank my SpaceX colleagues for grounding me in reality while letting me play with vehicles of the heavens. Go Falcon, Dragon, and Starlink!
