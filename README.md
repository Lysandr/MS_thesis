# My Master's Thesis
This my my Master's Thesis from my time at The Universtiy of Colorado Boulder, titled "A Successive Convexification Optimal Guidance
Implementation for the Pinpoint Landing of Space Vehicles." Dr. Robert D. Braun served as my advisor and my committee included Dr. Jay McMahon and Dr. Hanspeter Schaub.
