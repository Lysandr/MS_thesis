	I should begin with thanking Dr. Robert Braun for his support and advising through my Masters at Colorado Boulder. I would like to thank Professor Jay McMahon and Professor Hanspeter Schaub for serving on my committee and for their fulfilling coursework and advising. Additionally, I would like to thank Dr. Mason Peck for his four years of support at Cornell. I attribute most of my useful spacecraft engineering skills to the countless late nights spent on his projects.
	
	Similarly, I would like to thank my SpaceX colleagues for grounding me in reality while letting me play with vehicles of the heavens. Go Falcon, Dragon, and Starlink!
