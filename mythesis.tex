	Foremost, I am thankful to Dr. Robert Braun for his support and advising through my work at Colorado Boulder. I would like to thank Professor Jay McMahon and Professor Hanspeter Schaub for serving on my committee and for their fulfilling coursework and advising. Additionally, I would like to thank Dr. Mason Peck for his four years of support at Cornell, which serve as my foundation in this field.
	
	Similarly, I would like to thank my SpaceX colleagues for grounding me in reality while letting me play with vehicles of the heavens. Go Falcon, Dragon, and Starlink!
